# Fish Recognition Deep Learning Project

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for fish recognition. The model will be trained on a dataset of fish images and will be able to classify different species of fish accurately.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of labeled fish images. It includes various species of fish captured from different angles and under different lighting conditions. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.

## Model Architecture

The deep learning model used for fish recognition is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, followed by pooling layers and fully connected layers. The model is designed to learn and extract relevant features from the input images to make accurate predictions.

## Training

The model is trained using the training dataset. During the training process, the model learns to optimize its parameters by minimizing a predefined loss function. The training is performed using a suitable optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam optimizer. The model's performance is evaluated on the validation set, and the training process continues until satisfactory performance is achieved.

## Evaluation

Once the model is trained, its performance is evaluated on the testing dataset. The evaluation metrics used for this project include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify different fish species.

## Usage

To use the trained model for fish recognition, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Load the trained model weights.
3. Preprocess the input fish image.
4. Pass the preprocessed image through the model.
5. Obtain the predicted fish species.

## Results

The results obtained from the trained model are promising, with high accuracy and precision in fish species recognition. However, there is always room for improvement, and further fine-tuning of the model can be done to enhance its performance.
